# Ansible

## What is Ansible

>  Ansible is a radically simple IT automation system. It handles configuration management, application deployment, cloud provisioning, ad-hoc task execution, network automation, and multi-node orchestration. Ansible makes complex changes like zero-downtime rolling updates with load balancers easy. [1]

It seems that ansible focus on application publishing and updates, with some features of load balancing and service orchestration, which seems to be a subset of k8s. These functions can be provided by k8s, but many companies are currently using ansible. Maybe some places are different. Letâ€™s take a closer look.



## Install Ansible
